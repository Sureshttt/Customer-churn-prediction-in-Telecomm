# Customer-churn-prediction-in-Telecomm
With a high yearly churn rate of 25%, where customers switch to competitors, the industry faces a significant challenge. Adding to this, the cost of acquiring new customers is ten times higher than retaining existing ones, making it even more critical to predict churn effectively. Our motivation came from the opportunity to make a meaningful difference. By working on this project, we believed we could help telecommunications companies save substantial costs.
